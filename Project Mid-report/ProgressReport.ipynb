This is due to SteamDB requiring a valid Steam login with purchase history and frequent downloading causes timeouts and sometimes bans."

    "    > The distribution of review counts (log-transformed) for only paid Steam apps is displayed in this violin plot.  The x-axis shows if a game's price is zero, although all entries here indicate paid titles (is_free = False), as all free games were filtered out. By lessening the impact of outliers, the log_reviews transformation (log(1 + total_reviews)) helps highlight patterns. With thicker portions showing more games in that category, the graphic displays the density of paid games across different review count ranges. The median andÂ interquartile range are displayed in the box inside the violin, suggesting that the majority of paid games fall within a certain review volume. A long tail at the top indicates that some premium games get a disproportionately large number of reviews. Since free games are not included, we are better able to concentrate on trends in paidÂ games without being swayed by popular free-to-play games. We are more aware of the variation in user engagement (as measured by reviews) in the paid market category thanks to this visualization.\n",

    "- Why itâs interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > This visualization is interesting because it highlights the **uneven distribution of user engagement** among paid games on Steam. The quantity of reviews that the games receive varies greatly, despite the fact that they all cost money. A small percentage of paid games receive an excessively large number of reviews, whereas the majority just receive a low amount of attention. According to this long-tailed distribution, a few number of very successful games control user engagement, indicating that **success in the paid gaming market is not fairly shared**. Extreme outliers would otherwise hide these patterns, but the log scale makes them visible. It poses interesting considerations regarding the factors that influence popularity and exposure in the Steam marketplace. Additionally, since being a paid game does not ensure high interaction, it provides information into customer behavior. This plot helps developers and analysts evaluate player interest, spot market saturation, and plan their pricing and marketing strategies. In the end, it demonstrates that popularity among premium games is not merely uncommon, but unexpected.\n",

Since people aren't spending that much money ratings for these games are still quite high. When games cost more money (around the 1-50 price range) we start to see more outliers meaning that users are likely to leave lower reviews if they spend more money on the game they bought. The median still remains quite high for these games however. The 50-100 price range is typically where AAA games are priced and the median positive review ratio still remained high but we actually see less outliers compared to the games priced in the 5-50 range which is surprising. At the 100+ price range we see the lowest positive reviews with a median at 0.4 and a really wide spread of data.

    "> The violin plot compares the discount frequency between AAA and Indie games using the discount ratio (days discounted Ã· total days observed). Each violin shape represents the distribution of discount ratios within each game type. Wider sections indicate more games falling around that ratio.\n",
    "From the plot, Indie games generally show higher discount frequency, clustering around 70%â90% of the time discounted. In contrast, AAA games show more variability, with some frequently discounted and others much less so. This supports the idea that Indie titles rely more consistently on discounting as a marketing strategy, while AAA games are more selective.\n",

    "- **Initial insights:**\n",
    ">    So far, weâve observed that genre appears to play a notable role in pricing trendsâcertain genres tend to have higher average base prices and steeper discounts during major sales. User reviews and release dates also correlate interestingly with discount frequency and size. Early data exploration suggests that newer games receive fewer discounts initially, while older, positively reviewed games are more likely to be discounted heavily over time. These trends could help identify strategic pricing windows for developers or highlight what types of games benefit most from Steamâs promotional events.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Current biggest problems:**\n",
    ">    One major challenge has been the time-intensive nature of data collection, especially considering the vast size of the Steam catalog. We opted to limit our dataset to the top 100 games per genre to make the analysis more manageable. Another issue is ensuring consistency in tags and genre classifications, as some games fall into multiple overlapping categories. Lastly, we're still refining how to best represent discounts over timeâespecially for games with inconsistent or irregular pricing histories.\n",

Weâve divided responsibilities based on each memberâs strengths and have been communicating regularly to ensure alignment.
