Larger dots mean more games, giving context to how representative the average ratio is.

For example, if “Indie” appears at the top, it means that on average, players rate Indie games very positively.\n",

A high negative ratio suggests that games in that genre tend to receive more critical or dissatisfied reviews. This helps identify genres that may have issues with gameplay, quality, or audience expectations. Together, both plots give a balanced view of how different genres perform in terms of user sentiment. They can be used to compare genre reputation and player satisfaction patterns in the Steam game ecosystem.\n",
